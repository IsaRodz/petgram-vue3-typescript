# Petgram on Vue 3 with Typescript

A few months ago I built this simple app using the React JS library, then made a clone with React Native and then again using React with Typescript.
Now, since Vue 3 has been around for quite awhile I decided to replicate this dummy app using this awesome framework and why not take advantange of the TS features too.

This project was carried out with the purpose of learning and experimenting with these technologies

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

Before running this application in local you need to create a `.env.local` file and write a couple of variables into it:

```
VUE_APP_API_URL = https://dummyapi.io/data/v1
VUE_APP_APP_ID = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx // this is going to be your API ID
```

Then you can run the command below to run the app

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
